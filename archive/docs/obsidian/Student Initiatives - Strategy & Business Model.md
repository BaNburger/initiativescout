## Gap Analysis Summary

10 critical gaps were identified and addressed:

| Gap | Status | Solution |
|-----|--------|----------|
| No contact database | ✅ Fixed | tier1_contacts.md created |
| No CRM tracking | ⏸️ Later | After discovery calls |
| No university partnership | ✅ Ignore | Good faith relationship exists |
| No alumni tracking | ✅ Fixed | alumni_network.md created |
| No engagement funnel | ⏸️ Later | After discovery calls |
| No validated assumptions | 🔄 In Progress | 5 discovery calls this week |
| No competitive landscape | ⏸️ Later | Not critical for start |
| Business model unclear | ✅ Fixed | Scout + Syndicate defined |
| No selection framework | ✅ Exists | Rating system in place |
| No success metrics | ⏸️ Later | After initial deals |

## Key Assumptions to Validate

Discovery calls must answer:

1. **Do initiatives want external support at spinout?**
   - Hypothesis: Yes, they lack commercial expertise
   - Test: Direct ask in calls

2. **What support is most valuable?**
   - Hypothesis: Compute > Intros > Capital
   - Test: Rank in calls

3. **When is spinout timeline?**
   - Hypothesis: 6-24 months post-graduation
   - Test: Direct ask

4. **What's blocking them?**
   - Hypothesis: Regulatory, commercial, capital
   - Test: Open question

## Monitoring Strategy

**Primary Sources (Official Directories):**
- TUM: tum.de/community/campusleben/student-clubs-galerie
- LMU: lmu.de/de/workspace-fuer-studierende/studieren-und-leben/studentische-initiativen
- HM: hm.edu/studium_1/im_studium/rund_ums_studium/aktivitaeten

**Approach:**
- Weekly scraping of official directories
- Change detection (new additions, removals)
- Supplementary social media monitoring
- News alerts for competition wins, funding

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Initiatives don't want help | Validate with discovery calls first |
| Competition from accelerators | Position as complementary, not competing |
| University IP issues | Partner with TUM Venture Labs/ForTe |
| Deal flow too small | Expand to other Munich universities |
| Angels don't commit | Start with warm network, prove returns |

## Financial Projections (Year 1-2)
