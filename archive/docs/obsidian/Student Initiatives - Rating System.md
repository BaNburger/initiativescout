# Initiative Rating System

## Overview

We use a 4-dimension scoring system to evaluate student initiatives for spinout potential. Each dimension is scored 1-5, with weights applied to calculate a composite score.

## Dimensions

### 1. Tech Depth (30%)

Measures technical sophistication and innovation.

**Indicators:**
- Novel technology development
- Patents or publications
- GitHub complexity (languages, architecture)
- Technology recency (cutting-edge vs mature)
- Competition technical achievements

**Score Guide:**
| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Industry-defining tech (Stable Diffusion level) |
| 4 | Significant innovation with clear differentiation |
| 3 | Solid technical work, some novelty |
| 2 | Competent execution of known tech |
| 1 | Basic or derivative work |

### 2. Team Talent (25%)

Evaluates quality of team and leadership potential.

**Indicators:**
- Team size and growth
- Competition wins and recognitions
- Alumni success (founders who've moved on)
- University reputation factor
- Leadership quality

**Score Guide:**
| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | World-class team, multiple wins, proven leaders |
| 4 | Strong team with notable achievements |
| 3 | Competent team with some recognition |
| 2 | Small or inexperienced team |
| 1 | Unclear team structure |

### 3. Market Applicability (25%)

Assesses commercial potential of the technology.

**Indicators:**
- Technology-market fit
- B2B vs B2C clarity
- Industry partnerships
- Market size and timing
- Commercial activity signals

**Score Guide:**
| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Clear large market, proven demand, partnerships |
| 4 | Strong market potential, some validation |
| 3 | Market exists but fit needs work |
| 2 | Niche or uncertain market |
| 1 | Research-only, no clear market |

### 4. Maturity (20%)

Measures readiness for spinout.

**Indicators:**
- Years active
- Achievement consistency
- Infrastructure quality (web, social)
- Activity consistency
- Team stability

**Score Guide:**
| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | 5+ years, consistent wins, strong presence |
| 4 | 3-5 years, proven track record |
| 3 | 2-3 years, building momentum |
| 2 | 1-2 years, early stage |
| 1 | New or inconsistent |

## Composite Score Calculation

```
Composite = (Tech × 0.30) + (Talent × 0.25) + (Applicability × 0.25) + (Maturity × 0.20)
```

## Tier Classification

| Tier | Score Range | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Tier 1 | ≥ 4.0 | Immediate spinout potential |
| Tier 2 | 3.0 - 3.9 | Strong potential, needs development |
| Tier 3 | < 3.0 | Developing, monitor progress |

## Example Ratings

### TUM Autonomous Motorsport (Score: 5.0)
- Tech: 5 (world-class autonomous driving)
- Talent: 5 (PhD team, multiple wins)
- Applicability: 5 (automotive, logistics, robotics)
- Maturity: 5 (consistent wins, strong presence)

### Falcon Vision (Score: 3.75)
- Tech: 4 (novel rescue drone application)
- Talent: 4 (growing team, good progress)
- Applicability: 4 (SAR market, inspection)
- Maturity: 3 (started 2022, building)

## Calibration

The scoring system should be calibrated quarterly:
1. Review top performers for accuracy
2. Compare predictions vs actual spinout success
3. Adjust weights if needed
4. Document any changes
