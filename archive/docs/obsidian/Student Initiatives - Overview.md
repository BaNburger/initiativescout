# Student Initiatives - Deep Tech Startup Pipeline

## Executive Summary

Munich's student initiatives represent a unique opportunity for deep tech startup creation. These teams spend years developing cutting-edge technology while building cohesive teams - the exact ingredients for successful spinouts.

## The Thesis

**Student initiatives = Pre-built startup teams with proven technology**

Traditional startups face two major challenges:
1. Building teams from scratch
2. Developing technology while burning runway

Student initiatives solve both: they come with years of collaboration and working prototypes.

## Current Status

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Initiatives Tracked | 180+ |
| TUM Initiatives | 70+ |
| LMU Initiatives | 80+ |
| HM Initiatives | 31+ |
| Tier 1 (Immediate) | 10 |
| Tier 2 (Strong) | 15+ |

## Hot Opportunity

**HORYZN** - Won GoAERO Stage 2 in December 2025 (1 of 8 global winners from 200+ teams). eVTOL heavy-lift drones for emergency medical services. Contact immediately.

## Business Model

Per [[Student Initiatives - Strategy & Business Model]]:

**Year 1-2: Scout Program + Angel Syndicate (Hybrid)**
- Join 2-3 VC scout programs (Earlybird, HV Capital, Speedinvest)
- Run angel syndicate on Odin platform
- Zero capital required to start
- Build track record with 3-5 deals

**Year 3+: Solo GP Fund**
- Raise €15-25M micro-fund
- Focus on Munich deep tech spinouts
- Leverage scout + syndicate track record

## Support Model

We provide 4 pillars of support at spinout:

1. **Compute** - GPU/Cloud credits (via partners)
2. **Space** - Co-working and lab facilities
3. **Customers** - C-level enterprise introductions
4. **Capital** - Angel tickets from founder network
