### Pitch for Alumni Angels
```
"We're building a systematic pipeline from Munich's best student
initiatives to startups. You came from [their initiative] -
imagine if you'd had:
- Compute resources for early prototyping
- Customer intros when you were ready
- Angel capital from people who understood deep tech

We want to give the next WARR/START/TUfast teams that head start.
Would you back 1-2 deals per year at €25-50K?"
```
