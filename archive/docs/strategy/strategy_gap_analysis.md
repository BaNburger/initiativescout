# Strategy Gap Analysis
## Critical Review of Munich Student Initiatives Program

**Date:** 2026-02-02
**Purpose:** Identify blind spots, missing elements, and improvement opportunities

---

## Executive Summary

After reviewing the current strategy, I've identified **10 critical gaps** that could significantly impact success. The most urgent are:

1. **No contact database** - We know WHAT exists but not WHO to talk to
2. **No relationship/CRM tracking** - Conversations will get lost
3. **No university partnership strategy** - Are they allies or just data sources?
4. **No alumni tracking** - Missing a goldmine of warm introductions and potential angels
5. **No clear engagement funnel** - What happens after we identify a target?

## Gap Analysis by Category

### 1. DATA & INTELLIGENCE GAPS

#### 1.1 Missing: Contact Database
**Current State:** We have initiative names, websites, and descriptions.
**Gap:** No names, emails, LinkedIn profiles of initiative leaders.

**Impact:** Can't actually reach out. First contact becomes cold and inefficient.

**Solution:**
```
For each Tier 1-2 initiative, collect:
- President/Lead name
- Email (often on website or LinkedIn)
- LinkedIn profile
- Best contact method
- Previous interaction history
```

**Action:** Add contact enrichment to Phase 1 of tool development.

---

#### 1.2 Missing: Alumni Tracking
**Current State:** We track current initiatives.
**Gap:** No visibility into where alumni go.

**Impact:** Missing three opportunities:
1. Alumni who founded companies = warm intro targets
2. Alumni in industry = potential mentors/advisors
3. Alumni with capital = potential angels

**Example:** WARR has 60+ years of alumni. Where are they now? Some are certainly at SpaceX, Airbus, startups.

**Solution:**
- LinkedIn search for "[Initiative name] alumni"
- Track notable exits (Freeletics founders came from START Munich)
- Build alumni database over time

---

#### 1.3 Missing: Funding/Spinout History
**Current State:** We track current status.
**Gap:** No systematic tracking of previous spinouts or funding.

**Impact:** Can't learn from past successes. Can't identify patterns.

**Questions to answer:**
- Which initiatives have already spun out companies?
- What funding did those spinouts receive?
- What was the path from initiative → company?
- What support did they get (or wish they had)?

**Solution:** Research historical spinouts from each Tier 1 initiative.

---

#### 1.4 Missing: "What They Actually Need" Data
**Current State:** We assume they need compute, space, customers, capital.
**Gap:** We haven't asked them.

**Impact:** May be offering things they don't need, missing things they do.

**Hypothesis to test:**
- Do AI teams actually need more compute, or is cloud credit access fine?
- Do hardware teams need lab space, or do they have it at university?
- What's their actual bottleneck to spinout?

**Solution:** Discovery interviews with 5 Tier 1 initiatives before finalizing support model.

---

### 2. STRATEGIC GAPS

#### 2.1 Missing: University Partnership Strategy
**Current State:** Universities are data sources.
**Gap:** No relationship with university entrepreneurship offices.

**Impact:**
- Could be seen as competition to TUM Venture Labs, SCE, LMU IEC
- Missing co-investment and co-support opportunities
- No legitimacy signal from university blessing

**Key Stakeholders to Engage:**
| University | Entity | Why Important |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| TUM | TUM Venture Labs | 11 domain labs, deep tech focus |
| TUM | UnternehmerTUM | Europe's #1 startup hub |
| LMU | Innovation & Entrepreneurship Center | $2.5M+ funding awarded |
| HM | Strascheg Center (SCE) | #1 German Startup Radar |

**Solution:** Position as complementary partner, not competitor. Offer:
- Deal flow sharing
- Co-investment opportunities
- Access to your network (compute, angels)

---

#### 2.2 Missing: Competitive Landscape Analysis
**Current State:** We know our value prop.
**Gap:** Don't know who else is courting these teams.

**Competitors/Similar Programs:**
- TUM Venture Labs (already embedded)
- XPRENEURS (UnternehmerTUM)
- Entrepreneur First (talent investor)
- antler
- Various VC scout programs
- Corporate accelerators (BMW, Siemens, etc.)

**Questions:**
- Are Tier 1 initiatives already in accelerator programs?
- What offers have they received?
- What made them say yes/no?

**Solution:** Ask during discovery calls. Map competitive landscape.

---

#### 2.3 Missing: Business Model Clarity
**Current State:** Vague "support startups" model.
**Gap:** No clear monetization or sustainability plan.

**Options to clarify:**
| Model | Description | Sustainability |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Angel Syndicate** | Take equity in spinouts | Returns in 5-10 years |
| **Advisory Fees** | Charge for support services | Immediate but limits deal flow |
| **Fund Model** | Raise fund, deploy capital | LP returns required |
| **Corporate Sponsor** | Companies pay for access | Needs sponsor sales |
| **University Partnership** | Co-fund with university | Grant dependent |

**Recommendation:** Clarify primary model before partner pitches. Angels and compute partners will ask "what's in it for you?"

---

#### 2.4 Missing: Selection Framework
**Current State:** Score-based rating system.
**Gap:** Score alone doesn't capture fit or readiness.

**Additional Criteria Needed:**
```
Quantitative (our scores):
- Tech Depth (30%)
- Team Talent (25%)
- Market Applicability (25%)
- Maturity (20%)

Qualitative (missing):
- Spinout Intent: Do they actually want to start a company?
- Coachability: Will they take advice?
- Commitment: Full-time or side project?
- Timing: Ready now or in 2 years?
- Fit: Does their domain match our network?
```

**Solution:** Add "Spinout Readiness Assessment" as part of engagement process.

---

#### 2.5 Missing: Clear Value Proposition by Initiative Type
**Current State:** Generic 4-pillar support model.
**Gap:** Different initiatives need different things.

| Initiative Type | Primary Need | Secondary Need |
|-----------------|--------------|----------------|
| AI/ML teams | Compute credits | Data access |
| Hardware teams | Lab space, prototyping | Supplier intros |
| Space teams | Regulatory guidance | Industry connections |
| Biotech teams | Lab equipment | Long runway capital |
| Software teams | Customer intros | Hiring support |

**Solution:** Customize pitch by initiative domain.

---

### 3. OPERATIONAL GAPS

#### 3.1 Missing: Engagement Funnel/Playbook
**Current State:** "Reach out to Tier 1 initiatives"
**Gap:** No defined process from identification to spinout.

**Proposed Funnel:**
```
AWARENESS → DISCOVERY → ASSESSMENT → COMMITMENT → SUPPORT → SPINOUT
    ↓           ↓            ↓            ↓          ↓         ↓
 Outreach   First call   Deep dive    Terms     Active    Company
                                      agreed    support   formed
```

**For each stage, define:**
- Who is responsible?
- What materials do we need?
- What decisions are made?
- What's the timeline?
- What are the exit criteria?

**Solution:** Create engagement playbook document.

---

#### 3.2 Missing: CRM/Relationship Tracking
**Current State:** Initiative database.
**Gap:** No way to track conversations, commitments, follow-ups.

**Impact:** As you scale outreach, things will fall through cracks.

**Minimum Tracking:**
- Last contact date
- Contact method
- Key discussion points
- Next action
- Relationship owner
- Stage in funnel

**Solution Options:**
- Add to Notion (if using)
- Dex integration (you have MCP)
- Simple CRM (Airtable, HubSpot free)
- Things + notes (lightweight)

---

#### 3.3 Missing: Capacity Planning
**Current State:** Ambitious list of initiatives to support.
**Gap:** No assessment of our own capacity.

**Questions:**
- How many initiatives can you actively support at once?
- Who does what? (Outreach, partner management, support delivery)
- How much time does each initiative require?
- When do you need to hire/expand?

**Rough Estimate:**
- Active support per initiative: 5-10 hrs/month
- Partner management: 10-20 hrs/month total
- If 5 initiatives + partners: ~70-100 hrs/month = almost full-time

**Solution:** Define capacity and prioritize ruthlessly.

---

#### 3.4 Missing: Partner Onboarding Process
**Current State:** "Pitch compute partners"
**Gap:** No defined process for partner engagement.

**Questions:**
- What's the specific ask for each partner type?
- What do they get in return?
- What's the commitment structure?
- How do credits/resources flow to initiatives?
- What reporting do partners expect?

**Solution:** Create partner pitch deck variations and term sheets.

---

### 4. MEASUREMENT GAPS

#### 4.1 Missing: Success Metrics & KPIs
**Current State:** No defined success criteria.
**Gap:** Can't measure progress or ROI.

**Proposed KPIs:**

| Metric | Target (Year 1) | Why |
|--------|-----------------|-----|
| Initiatives engaged | 20 | Pipeline building |
| Discovery calls completed | 15 | Qualification |
| Initiatives in active support | 5 | Capacity constraint |
| Spinouts formed | 2 | Primary outcome |
| Angel investments made | 3 | Financial outcome |
| Compute credits deployed | $100K | Partner value |
| Partner commitments | 2 | Sustainability |

**Solution:** Define metrics before launch, track monthly.

---

#### 4.2 Missing: Feedback Loops
**Current State:** Score initiatives once.
**Gap:** No mechanism for learning and improving.

**Feedback to collect:**
- From initiatives: What was helpful? What was missing?
- From partners: Are they getting value?
- From angels: Deal quality feedback
- Internal: What's working in outreach?

**Solution:** Quarterly review process with all stakeholders.

---

### 5. TECHNICAL/TOOL GAPS

#### 5.1 Missing: Cross-University Initiative Tracking
**Current State:** Track by university.
**Gap:** Some initiatives span TUM/LMU (iGEM Munich, Akaflieg).

**Solution:** Add "affiliated universities" field, de-duplicate.

---

#### 5.2 Missing: Event/News Intelligence
**Current State:** News aggregation planned.
**Gap:** No proactive monitoring of relevant events.

**Events to track:**
- Competition schedules (Formula Student, Shell Eco-Marathon, iGEM, etc.)
- Hackathon dates
- Demo days
- Funding announcements

**Impact:** Timing outreach around wins is powerful (like HORYZN now).

---

#### 5.3 Missing: Integration with Your Systems
**Current State:** Database is standalone markdown.
**Gap:** Not integrated with Things, Obsidian, Dex.

**Ideal Flow:**
```
Database → Obsidian (knowledge)
        → Things (tasks/follow-ups)
        → Dex (contact management)
        → Alerts (email/Slack)
```

**Solution:** Build integrations in Phase 2 of tool.

---

## Priority Recommendations

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **Discovery calls with 3-5 Tier 1 initiatives** - Validate assumptions about what they need
2. **Contact enrichment** - Find LinkedIn/email for HORYZN, TUM Autonomous, TUM Boring leads
3. **University outreach** - Informal coffee with TUM Venture Labs to position as partner

### Short-Term (This Month)

4. **Create engagement playbook** - Document the funnel stages
5. **Define success metrics** - What does year 1 success look like?
6. **Partner pitch refinement** - Customize for specific compute partners
7. **Alumni research** - Where did START Munich unicorn founders come from?

### Medium-Term (This Quarter)

8. **CRM setup** - Track relationships properly
9. **Competitive landscape mapping** - Who else is in this space?
10. **Business model decision** - Angel syndicate, fund, or other?

---

## Questions to Answer Before Scaling

1. Do initiatives actually want external support, or are they happy with university resources?
2. What's the typical timeline from "interested in spinout" to "company formed"?
3. What's the legal structure for angel investments through a syndicate?
4. How do we handle IP that was developed at university?
5. What happens if an initiative we support fails or pivots?
6. How do we avoid conflicts with university entrepreneurship programs?
7. What's our differentiation vs existing accelerators?

---

## Conclusion

The research and planning foundation is solid. The critical gaps are:

1. **Tactical:** Contact database, CRM, engagement playbook
2. **Strategic:** University partnerships, competitive positioning, business model
3. **Operational:** Capacity planning, success metrics, feedback loops

**Recommended Next Step:** Before scaling outreach, conduct 5 discovery calls with Tier 1 initiatives to validate assumptions and refine the value proposition.
