# Business Model Analysis
## From Angel Syndicate to Solo GP Fund

**Date:** 2026-02-02
**Purpose:** Evaluate investment vehicle options for student initiative spinout support
**Context:** €25-50K initial tickets, deep tech focus, Munich ecosystem

---

## Executive Summary

For your situation - deep tech focus, €25-50K tickets, limited track record, Munich ecosystem - I recommend a **staged approach**:

**Year 1-2:** Scout Program + Syndicate Building
**Year 3+:** Solo GP Micro-Fund (if validated)

This minimizes upfront capital, builds track record, and creates optionality.

## Model Comparison Matrix

| Model | Capital Needed | Time to First Deal | Management Burden | Carry Potential | Best For |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Angel Syndicate** | €0 | 2-4 weeks | Low | 15-20% | Building track record |
| **Scout Program** | €0 | 4-6 weeks | Minimal | 10-20% | Learning, network access |
| **Rolling Fund** | €500K-2M/quarter | 3-4 weeks | Medium | 20% | Steady deployment |
| **SPV per Deal** | €50-100K personal | 3-4 weeks | Low | 15-20% | Opportunistic |
| **Solo GP Fund** | €10-30M committed | 9-12 months | High | 20-25% | Scale |

## Option 1: Angel Syndicate Model

### How It Works
You lead deals on a platform (AngelList, Odin in Europe). Investors commit per-deal. You earn carry on successful exits.

### Economics
```
Deal: €250K round, you find €100K from syndicate
Your commitment: €5-10K (credibility)
Carry: 15-20% of profits
Management fee: 0-2% (optional)

Example exit:
- Invest €100K at €2M valuation
- Exit at €50M valuation (25x)
- Returns: €2.5M
- Your carry (20%): €500K
```

### Pros
- Zero/minimal upfront capital
- Per-deal flexibility
- Build investor network
- Learn deal mechanics
- Platform handles admin

### Cons
- Must convince investors per deal
- No guaranteed capital
- Lower carry than fund
- Reputational risk if deals fail

### European Platforms
- **Odin** (UK/EU focus) - Stripe-backed, automated SPVs
- **AngelList** - US-focused but EU expanding
- **Angel Engine** - German/DACH focus
- **SeedBlink** - CEE focus

### Verdict for You
**GOOD START** - Low risk, builds track record, tests thesis.

---

## Option 2: Scout Program

### How It Works
Established VC gives you allocation (€200K-€500K/year) to invest. You source deals, they provide capital. You earn carry on your sourced deals.

### Economics
```
Allocation: €300K/year
Your carry: 10-20% of profits on your deals
VC carry: 20% (they take from fund)
Your effective carry: ~15-18%
Management fee: None for you (fund covers)
```

### Notable Scout Programs
- **Sequoia Scout** - 1,000+ companies sourced since 2009
- **a16z** - Added 20+ European scouts in 2025
- **First Round** - Strong scout network
- **European examples:** Balderton, Northzone, EQT scouts

### How to Get a Scout Position
1. Demonstrate deal flow access (your initiative network!)
2. Show domain expertise (deep tech knowledge)
3. Have some investing experience (even angel)
4. Network into VC firms with scout programs

### Pros
- Zero capital required
- Access VC network/resources
- Learn from professionals
- Build track record with OPM
- Carry on sourced deals

### Cons
- Must find sponsor VC
- Limited autonomy
- VC gets first look at deals
- May conflict with your own investing

### Verdict for You
**EXCELLENT OPTION** - Your initiative pipeline is exactly what scouts need. Apply to 3-5 VCs with EU deep tech focus.

---

## Option 3: Rolling Fund

### How It Works
Quarterly subscription fund. LPs commit per quarter. You deploy continuously.

### Economics
```
Quarterly raise: €500K-€2M
Annual deployment: €2M-€8M
Management fee: 2% annually
Carry: 20%
Fund admin: Platform handles

Year 1: 4 quarters × €500K = €2M deployed
Carry on €2M (assuming 3x): €1.2M
```

### Platforms
- **AngelList Rolling Funds** - Primary platform
- Limited EU availability currently

### Pros
- Continuous fundraising
- Lower commitment threshold for LPs
- Flexibility in deployment pace
- Platform handles admin

### Cons
- Must raise every quarter (fundraising never stops)
- €500K+ minimum scale
- LP fatigue risk
- Less common in Europe

### Verdict for You
**NOT YET** - Requires larger scale and continuous fundraising. Consider after proving model.

---

## Option 4: Solo GP Micro-Fund

### How It Works
Traditional fund structure, just you as GP. Raise €10-30M from LPs, deploy over 3-4 years.

### Economics
```
Fund size: €15M
Management fee: 2% = €300K/year
Investments: 20-30 deals at €300-500K
Carry: 20% above hurdle (typically 8%)

Successful scenario:
- Fund returns 3x = €45M
- Profit: €30M
- Carry (20%): €6M over fund life
```

### Requirements
1. **Track record** - Prior investing experience
2. **LP network** - HNWIs, family offices, fund-of-funds
3. **Legal structure** - AIFM registration or exemption
4. **Time commitment** - Full-time job
5. **GP commitment** - 1-2% of fund (~€150-300K)

### German/EU Regulatory
- **AIFMD 2.0** (April 2026): Funds <€100M with no leverage can use simplified regime
- **BaFin registration**: Required but streamlined for small AIFs
- **Setup cost**: €20-50K legal, €10-20K ongoing compliance

### Pros
- Committed capital (can plan)
- Professional structure
- Higher carry potential
- Build lasting institution

### Cons
- 9-12 months to first close
- Significant GP commitment
- Full regulatory compliance
- Fundraising intensive
- Career commitment

### European Solo GP Examples
- **PSV Hafnium** (deep tech focus)
- **SB21** (Berlin, student founder focus)
- **U2V** (university spinouts)
- **Calm Company Fund** (bootstrapped focus)

### Verdict for You
**LONG-TERM GOAL** - After 2-3 years of syndicate/scout track record. Not Year 1.

---

## Option 5: Hybrid Model (Recommended)

### Structure
Combine scout program with personal syndicate:

```
PHASE 1 (Year 1-2):
├── Scout Position at VC (€200-500K allocation)
│   └── Source deals from initiative pipeline
│   └── Earn 10-20% carry on sourced deals
│   └── Learn, build network
│
└── Personal Syndicate (parallel)
    └── Lead 2-3 deals/year you're passionate about
    └── Raise €50-150K per deal from angels
    └── €5-10K personal per deal
    └── Earn 15-20% carry

PHASE 2 (Year 3+):
├── IF validated: Raise Solo GP Fund (€15-25M)
└── IF not: Continue hybrid, no harm done
```

### Why This Works

1. **Zero/minimal capital to start**
   - Scout: €0
   - Syndicate: €5-10K per deal

2. **Multiple carry streams**
   - Scout carry: 10-20%
   - Syndicate carry: 15-20%
   - Combined exposure to 10+ deals

3. **Risk mitigation**
   - VC bears risk on scout deals
   - Syndicate investors bear risk on your deals
   - Your downside limited to personal commitments

4. **Track record building**
   - Documented investing history
   - References from VC sponsor
   - Auditable returns (for future fund)

5. **Network effects**
   - VC network for follow-on
   - Syndicate investors become fund LPs
   - Initiative alumni become angels

### Financial Model (5 Years)

```
YEAR 1:
- Scout: 3 deals × €100K = €300K deployed
- Syndicate: 2 deals × €75K = €150K deployed
- Personal capital: €15K
- Income: €0 (investments maturing)

YEAR 2:
- Scout: 4 deals × €100K = €400K deployed
- Syndicate: 3 deals × €100K = €300K deployed
- Personal capital: €25K
- Income: €0 (investments maturing)

YEAR 3:
- Continue pattern + first exits starting
- Early carries materializing
- Income: €30-100K (early small exits)

YEAR 4-5:
- Major exits if thesis works
- Scout carry: €50-150K
- Syndicate carry: €100-300K
- Total potential: €150-450K in carry

YEAR 5+ (IF FUND):
- Raise €15-25M fund
- Management fees: €300-500K/year
- Build carry pool
```

## Decision Framework

### Choose Scout + Syndicate Hybrid If:
- [ ] Limited capital (<€50K to invest personally)
- [ ] No prior fund management track record
- [ ] Want to test thesis before committing
- [ ] Can't go full-time immediately
- [ ] Need to build LP network

### Choose Solo GP Fund If:
- [ ] €150K+ available for GP commitment
- [ ] 3+ years investing track record with documented returns
- [ ] Can commit full-time
- [ ] Have 5-10 committed LP relationships
- [ ] Thesis validated through prior deals

### Red Flags - Don't Do Solo GP Yet:
- No documented investment track record
- Can't name 3 LPs who would commit €500K+
- Don't understand fund economics deeply
- Viewing it as "easier than getting a job"
- Can't commit €100K+ personally

## Key Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target (Year 1) | Target (Year 2) |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Deals sourced (scout) | 3-4 | 6-8 |
| Deals led (syndicate) | 2-3 | 4-5 |
| Capital deployed | €400-500K | €800K-1M |
| Follow-on rate | N/A | 30%+ |
| Syndicate investors | 10-15 | 20-30 |
| Portfolio company intros made | 10+ | 25+ |

## Appendix: Regulatory Notes (Germany/EU)

### AIFMD 2.0 (Effective April 2026)
- Funds <€100M with no leverage: simplified registration
- Small AIF manager exemption remains
- Annual reporting to BaFin required

### Prospectus Exemption
- SPVs <€1M per offering exempt
- Can do multiple SPVs under exemption
- No retail investor restrictions for qualified investors

### Recommended Legal Setup
- GmbH as GP entity
- Individual SPV (KG or GmbH & Co. KG) per deal
- Platform (Odin) handles most structure
- Budget: €5-10K for initial setup

---

## Conclusion

**Recommended Path:**

1. **Now:** Apply for 3-5 scout positions at EU VCs
2. **Month 2:** Set up syndicate structure on Odin
3. **Month 3:** First syndicate deal
4. **Year 1-2:** Build track record via both channels
5. **Year 3+:** Evaluate Solo GP fund based on results

This approach:
- Requires minimal capital (€15-25K Year 1)
- Builds track record
- Tests thesis with OPM
- Creates optionality for fund
- Generates carry from day 1

The initiative pipeline you've built is the **key asset**. Most scouts struggle to find deals - you have 180+ mapped with ratings. Lead with that in scout applications.
