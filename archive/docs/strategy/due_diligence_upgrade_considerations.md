# Why Rankings Are Still Poor And What True DD Requires

## Current Failure Modes (Observed)
1. Universe contamination: non-investable clubs/chapters are mixed with spinout-ready teams.
2. Score-floor collapse: many initiatives sit at or near dimension floor due to sparse evidence.
3. Evidence weakness: top-ranked items often have minimal ranking evidence attribution.
4. Keyword inflation: generic website language can inflate market/problem signals.
5. Talent noise: person extraction still admits non-person entities from website/nav text.
6. Missing critical DD dimensions: no customer proof, legal/IP readiness, or execution-risk depth.

## Diagnostic Snapshot (Current Dataset)
1. Initiatives scored: 287.
2. Floor counts (latest per initiative): tech=111, team=185, market=78, actionability=114, support_fit=136.
3. Lens score range: outreach 1.0-4.119, upside 1.0-3.832.
4. Component sparsity: many component rows still have zero evidence.
5. Ranking evidence density: lens rankings still show low evidence breadth per item.

## What Data We Must Pull For Real Investment Confidence
## Team DD
1. Named core founders/operators, role clarity, commitment timeline.
2. Team quality signals: prior build outcomes, technical depth by member, reference quality.
3. Org health: hiring momentum, retention proxies, execution cadence.

## Technology DD
1. Codebase health: repo activity, bus factor, test/CI quality, release cadence.
2. Technical proof: benchmarks, prototype test results, reproducibility evidence.
3. IP position: patent/publication mapping, ownership, licensing constraints, FTO risk.

## Market DD
1. Customer proof: LOIs, pilots, paid pilots, customer interviews with quality scoring.
2. Commercial logic: pricing evidence, sales-cycle realism, buyer persona clarity.
3. Market model: bottom-up SAM/SOM with assumptions and sensitivity.

## Execution DD
1. 12-18 month milestone plan with resource dependencies.
2. Regulatory/approval path where relevant.
3. Supply chain/manufacturing readiness for hardware teams.

## Legal And Deal DD
1. Entity status, founder agreements, assignment of IP.
2. Cap table/funding dependence and dilution outlook.
3. Compliance exposure: privacy/security/export-control where applicable.

## Required Gating Model
1. Gate A: Investable team exists.
2. Gate B: Technical proof is real and verifiable.
3. Gate C: Market pull is real and evidenced.
4. Gate D: Legal/IP constraints are manageable.
5. Only initiatives passing all gates receive “investable ranking”.

## Decision Output Standard
1. For each investable initiative: tech-team-market thesis, key risks, required support package, next 30-day actions, and explicit “invest / monitor / pass” recommendation.
